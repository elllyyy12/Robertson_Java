// This is like my Main.java which is where I called all the methods in MapleTreeDriver.java. I coded this by following the video,
// on the course. I would also like to inform who ever checks my codes that I am very sorry if I have no comments on how my code works,
// on my previous submission. I didn't know at first that it's needed. Thank you.
